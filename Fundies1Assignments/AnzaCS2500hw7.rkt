;; Usual Instructions:
;; 1. Do not create, modify or delete any line that begins with ";;!". These are
;;    markers that we use to segment your file into parts to facilitate grading.
;; 2. You must follow the _design recipe_ for every problem. In particular,
;;    every function you define must have at least three check-expects (and
;;    more if needed).
;; 3. You must follow the Style Guide:
;;    https://pages.github.khoury.northeastern.edu/2500/2023F/style.html
;; 4. You must submit working code. In DrRacket, ensure you get no errors
;;    when you click Run. After you submit on Gradescope, you'll get instant
;;    feedback on whether or Gradescope can run your code, and your code must
;;    run on Gradescope to receive credit from the autograder.

;; 1. You must use list abstractions to receive credit. Do not write directly ;;
;;    recursive functions.                                                    ;;
;; 2. You may use Lambda if you wish.                                         ;;
;; 3. Many problems have provided signatures and purpose statements that you  ;;
;;    should not modify.                                                      ;;
